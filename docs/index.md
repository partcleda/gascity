description: Contributor-facing documentation for the Gas City orchestration SDK.
---

Gas City is an orchestration-builder SDK for multi-agent systems. This docs
tree is organized for external contributors first: install the toolchain, run a
local city, find the relevant subsystem, and then decide whether you need
current-state architecture docs, forward-looking design docs, or archived
working notes.

## Start Here

- [Installation](getting-started/installation) explains the local toolchain
  and the shortest path to a working `gc` binary.
- [Quickstart](getting-started/quickstart) walks through the smallest city
  you can boot locally.
- [Coming from Gas Town](getting-started/coming-from-gastown) maps Town
  roles, commands, plugins, convoys, and filesystem habits onto Gas City's
  primitives.
- [Repository Map](getting-started/repository-map) explains where the CLI,
  runtime, config, store, and controller code live.
- [Contributors](/contributors) collects the project rules, testing
  expectations, and codebase map.

## Documentation Types

- [Tutorials](/tutorials): end-to-end walkthroughs that teach the user
  model.
- [Guides](/guides): practical docs for specific workflows like packs
  and Kubernetes.
- [Reference](/reference): command, config, formula, and provider
  lookup docs.
- [Architecture](/architecture): how Gas City works today.
- [Design](/design): proposals, accepted plans, and historical design
  context.
- [Archive](/archive): audits, backlogs, roadmaps, and research notes
  that should not be mistaken for the current contributor path.

## Repository Context

Gas City is the open-source SDK extracted from Gas Town. The public docs now
separate current contributor guidance from historical planning material so new
readers can get oriented without reading every audit and roadmap first.
